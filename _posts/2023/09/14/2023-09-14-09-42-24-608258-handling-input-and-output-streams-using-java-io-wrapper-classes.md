In Java, input and output streams are used to read from and write to various data sources such as files, network connections, and standard input/output. To simplify the process, Java provides a set of wrapper classes that encapsulate the low-level I/O operations in a more convenient way. In this article, we will explore how to handle input and output streams using Java I/O wrapper classes.

## InputStream and OutputStream

Java's `java.io` package provides two fundamental abstract classes - `InputStream` and `OutputStream` - which serve as the base for all input and output streams. These classes provide the basic functionality needed to read and write data, but they can't be used directly. Instead, they are used as the foundation for higher-level wrapper classes.

## FileReader and FileWriter

If you need to read or write character data from files, you can use the `FileReader` and `FileWriter` classes. These classes use streams internally and provide a convenient way to handle character-based input and output.

To read text from a file using `FileReader`, you can follow this code snippet:

\```java
try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("filename.txt")) {
    int character;
    while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
        System.out.print((char) character);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
\```

In the above code, we create a `FileReader` object by passing the filename as a parameter. Inside the `while` loop, we read each character from the file until we reach the end of the file (-1). The `read()` method returns an `int` representation of the character, so we cast it to `char` to print it.

For writing text to a file using `FileWriter`, you can use the following code snippet:

\```java
try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("filename.txt")) {
    writer.write("Hello, World!");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
\```

Here, we create a `FileWriter` object and use the `write()` method to write the specified text to the file.

## ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream

If you want to read from or write to an in-memory byte array, you can use `ByteArrayInputStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

To read bytes from a byte array using `ByteArrayInputStream`, you can use the following code:

\```java
byte[] byteArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
try (ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray)) {
    int data;
    while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {
        System.out.println(data);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
\```

In this code snippet, we create a `ByteArrayInputStream` object and pass the byte array as a parameter. The `read()` method is used to read individual bytes from the array until the end is reached.

To write bytes to a byte array using `ByteArrayOutputStream`, you can use the following code:

\```java
try (ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream()) {
    outputStream.write(1);
    outputStream.write(2);
    outputStream.write(3);
    byte[] byteArray = outputStream.toByteArray();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
\```

Here, we create a `ByteArrayOutputStream` object and use the `write()` method to write individual bytes to the stream. Finally, we can retrieve the written data as a byte array using the `toByteArray()` method.

## Conclusion

Handling input and output streams is an essential part of Java programming, and using wrapper classes provided by Java's `java.io` package simplifies the process. In this article, we explored how to handle input and output streams using the `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `ByteArrayInputStream`, and `ByteArrayOutputStream` classes. These wrapper classes provide high-level abstractions for performing I/O operations, making it easier and more convenient to work with streams in Java.
