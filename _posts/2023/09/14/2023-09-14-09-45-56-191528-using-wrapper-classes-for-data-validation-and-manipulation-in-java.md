When working with data in Java, it's important to ensure its correctness and manipulate it as needed. One way to achieve this is by using wrapper classes, which provide convenient methods for data validation and manipulation. In this article, we will explore how to use wrapper classes for data validation and manipulation in Java.

## Why use Wrapper Classes?

Wrapper classes in Java are used to convert primitive data types into objects. This allows us to access methods and perform operations on data that would otherwise not be possible with primitive types.

Wrapper classes also provide useful methods for data validation and manipulation. For example, the `Integer` class has methods such as `parseInt()` to convert a string to an integer, `valueOf()` to convert primitive types to `Integer` objects, and `toString()` to convert an `Integer` object to a string representation.

## Data Validation

Wrapper classes can be used for data validation, ensuring that the data is of the correct type and within certain bounds. For example, let's say we have a user input that should be an integer within the range of 1 to 100.

```java
String userInput = "42"; // Assuming this is user input
int inputNumber;

try {
    inputNumber = Integer.parseInt(userInput);
    if (inputNumber < 1 || inputNumber > 100) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input out of range");
    }
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input format");
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert the user input to an integer. If the input is not a valid integer, a `NumberFormatException` will be thrown. We then check if the input number falls within the desired range, and if not, we throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Data Manipulation

Wrapper classes can also be used to manipulate data by providing convenient methods. For example, let's say we have a variable `count` of type `Integer` that represents the number of items in a shopping cart. We want to increment the count by 1.

```java
Integer count = 3;
count++; // Increment the count by 1
System.out.println(count); // Output: 4
```

In the above code, we simply use the `++` operator to increment the `count` by 1. This is possible because `count` is an `Integer` object, not a primitive `int`.

## Conclusion

Wrapper classes in Java provide a powerful way to validate and manipulate data. By converting primitive types into objects, we gain access to useful methods for data validation and manipulation. Whether it's validating user input or performing arithmetic operations, wrapper classes are a valuable tool for data handling in Java.
