Java provides a set of **wrapper classes** that are used to convert primitive data types into objects. These wrapper classes provide additional functionalities and help in handling primitive data types in an object-oriented way. In this blog post, we will explore the various functionalities of Java wrapper classes.

## What are Wrapper Classes?

Wrapper classes in Java are used to convert primitive data types (such as `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) into objects. They are called "wrapper" classes because they "wrap" the primitive data types into objects.

The following table shows the wrapper classes available in Java:

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
|----------------|---------------|
| `byte`         | `Byte`        |
| `short`        | `Short`       |
| `int`          | `Integer`     |
| `long`         | `Long`        |
| `float`        | `Float`       |
| `double`       | `Double`      |
| `char`         | `Character`   |
| `boolean`      | `Boolean`     |

## Functionalities of Wrapper Classes

### 1. Converting Primitive Types to Objects

The primary functionality of wrapper classes is to convert primitive data types to their corresponding object representation. This allows us to use primitive types in object-oriented programming scenarios. For example:

```java
int num = 10;
Integer obj = Integer.valueOf(num);  // Converting int to Integer object
```

### 2. Converting Objects to Primitive Types

Wrapper classes also provide methods to convert their objects back to their corresponding primitive data types. This is useful when we need to perform operations that only accept primitive types. For example:

```java
Integer obj = Integer.valueOf(20);
int num = obj.intValue();  // Converting Integer object to int
```

### 3. Handling Null Values

Wrapper classes provide a special constant value called `null` to indicate the absence of an object. This is particularly useful when dealing with scenarios where a value may or may not be present. For example:

```java
Integer obj = null;
```

### 4. Useful Methods

Wrapper classes provide several methods that can be utilized to perform various operations on the underlying primitive types. Some of the commonly used methods include:

- `parseInt(String s)`: Converts a string representation of a number into an `int`.
- `doubleValue()`: Returns the value of the wrapper object as a `double`.
- `compareTo(Integer anotherInteger)`: Compares two Integer objects numerically.

## Conclusion

Wrapper classes in Java provide additional functionalities to handle primitive data types as objects. They allow us to perform operations that are exclusive to object-oriented programming and provide convenient methods for data conversions. By leveraging the functionalities provided by wrapper classes, we can write cleaner and more efficient code.
