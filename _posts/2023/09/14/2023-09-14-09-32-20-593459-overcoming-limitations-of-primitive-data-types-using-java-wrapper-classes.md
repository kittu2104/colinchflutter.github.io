In Java, primitive data types such as int, float, and boolean are simple and efficient. However, they have certain limitations that can be overcome by using **Java wrapper classes**. Wrapper classes are classes that encapsulate primitive data types and provide additional methods and functionality.

## 1. Limited Operations

Primitive data types have limited operations that can be performed on them. For example, you cannot call methods or perform any complex operations on an int or float directly. However, by using wrapper classes such as **Integer** and **Float**, you can overcome this limitation.

```java
int number = 10;
Integer integerNumber = Integer.valueOf(number); // Wrapping the primitive value

int result = integerNumber.intValue(); // Unwrapping the value
int squared = integerNumber.intValue() * integerNumber.intValue(); // Performing additional operations

System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.println("Squared: " + squared);
```

## 2. Null Values

Primitive data types cannot store null values, which can be vital in certain scenarios. However, by using their respective wrapper classes, you can assign null values to the variables.

```java
Integer nullableInteger = null; // Wrapper class can hold a null value
Float nullableFloat = null; // Wrapper class can hold a null value

if (nullableInteger == null) {
   System.out.println("Nullable integer is null");
}

if (nullableFloat == null) {
   System.out.println("Nullable float is null");
}
```

## 3. Object-oriented Features

Primitive data types lack object-oriented features such as inheritance or polymorphism. However, by using wrapper classes, which are objects, you can utilize these features.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(); // Using Integer object

numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(10);

int sum = 0;
for (Integer number : numbers) {
   sum += number;
}

System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```

## Conclusion

By using Java wrapper classes, you can overcome the limitations of primitive data types and leverage their additional features and flexibility. Wrapper classes provide methods, nullability, and compatibility with object-oriented features, making them a powerful tool for manipulating and working with data.
