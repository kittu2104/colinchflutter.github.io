Distributed systems require robust coordination mechanisms to ensure concurrency and consistency when multiple processes access shared resources. In Java, **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)** is a popular technology that allows distributed objects to communicate and invoke methods on remote systems.

## Introduction to Java RMI

Java RMI is a framework that enables objects residing on different Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) to interact with each other by invoking remote methods. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create distributed applications.

To use RMI, you need to define an interface that extends the `java.rmi.Remote` interface. The methods declared in this interface represent the remote methods that can be invoked by clients. Each method must throw a `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface MyRemoteInterface extends Remote {
    void someMethod() throws RemoteException;
    Object anotherMethod(String param) throws RemoteException;
}
```

Next, you implement the server class that extends `java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject` and implements the remote interface. The server class must be able to create a well-known registry where clients can lookup and connect to the server object.

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;

public class MyRemoteServerClass extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    public MyRemoteServerClass() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public void someMethod() throws RemoteException {
        // Method implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Object anotherMethod(String param) throws RemoteException {
        // Method implementation
        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            MyRemoteServerClass server = new MyRemoteServerClass();
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            registry.rebind("MyRemoteObject", server);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

The client code can invoke remote methods of the server by obtaining a remote reference from the server's registry.

```java
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;

public class MyRemoteClientClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("server-hostname", 1099);
            MyRemoteInterface remoteObject = (MyRemoteInterface) registry.lookup("MyRemoteObject");
            remoteObject.someMethod();
            Object result = remoteObject.anotherMethod("param");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Distributed Locking Mechanisms

In distributed systems, it is crucial to ensure mutual exclusion when multiple processes attempt to access shared resources concurrently. **Distributed locking mechanisms** provide a way to acquire and release locks across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

One commonly used distributed locking mechanism is the **ZooKeeper** coordination service. ZooKeeper provides a simple API for clients to create, acquire, and release locks in a distributed environment.

```java
import org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper;
import org.apache.zookeeper.WatchedEvent;
import org.apache.zookeeper.Watcher;
import org.apache.zookeeper.CreateMode;
import org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException;

public class DistributedLockExample {
    private static final String ZOOKEEPER_CONNECTION_STRING = "localhost:2181";
    private static final int SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3000;
    private static final String LOCK_PATH = "/mylock";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ZooKeeper zooKeeper = new ZooKeeper(ZOOKEEPER_CONNECTION_STRING, SESSION_TIMEOUT, new Watcher() {
            public void process(WatchedEvent watchedEvent) {
                // Handle ZooKeeper events
            }
        });

        try {
            // Create a lock node
            String lockPath = zooKeeper.create(LOCK_PATH, new byte[0], ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode.EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL);

            // Attempt to acquire the lock
            while (true) {
                List<String> children = zooKeeper.getChildren("/mylock", false);
                Collections.sort(children);
                if (lockPath.endsWith(children.get(0))) {
                    // Lock acquired, execute critical section
                    break;
                } else {
                    // Lock not acquired, wait for lock release
                    synchronized (lockPath) {
                        lockPath.wait();
                    }
                }
            }

            // Critical section
            // ...

            // Release the lock
            zooKeeper.delete(lockPath, -1);
            synchronized (lockPath) {
                lockPath.notifyAll();
            }
        } catch (KeeperException | InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            zooKeeper.close();
        }
    }
}
```

By utilizing Java RMI and distributed locking mechanisms like ZooKeeper, developers can create robust, distributed systems that handle concurrency and coordination effectively. These technologies play a vital role in building scalable and reliable applications in today's distributed computing landscape.
