Apache Heron is a real-time distributed stream processing engine that provides an efficient and scalable platform for processing large amounts of data in real-time. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) with Apache Heron to enable the communication between distributed components in a Heron topology.

## What is Java RMI?

Java RMI is a built-in mechanism in Java that allows a Java program running on one machine to invoke methods of objects running on another machine. It provides a way for distributed components to communicate with each other transparently, as if they were local objects.

## Integrating Java RMI with Apache Heron

To integrate Java RMI with Apache Heron, follow these steps:

1. Define the Remote Interface: Create an interface that contains the methods that will be invoked remotely. This interface should extend the `java.rmi.Remote` interface and each method should throw a `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface MyRemoteInterface extends Remote {
    void performOperation() throws RemoteException;
}
```

2. Implement the Remote Object: Create a class that implements the remote interface defined in the previous step. This class should extend the `java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject` class and implement the methods defined in the interface.

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteImplementation extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    public MyRemoteImplementation() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public void performOperation() throws RemoteException {
        // Implementation logic
    }
}
```

3. Create a Registry: The RMI registry acts as a central repository for locating remote objects. It can be created using the `java.rmi.registry.Registry` class.

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class MyRmiRegistry {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);

        // Register the remote object
        MyRemoteInterface remoteObject = new MyRemoteImplementation();
        registry.rebind("RemoteObject", remoteObject);

        System.out.println("RMI registry started and object registered successfully.");
    }
}
```

4. Configure Apache Heron: In your Heron topology, use the `HeronSubmitter` class to set the `heron.class.imports` property and provide the package name where your RMI interfaces and implementations are located.

```java
import org.apache.heron.api.HeronSubmitter;
import org.apache.heron.api.topology.TopologyBuilder;

public class MyHeronTopology {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();

        // Define your Heron topology

        // Set the heron.class.imports property to include the RMI package
        HeronSubmitter.submitTopology("MyTopology", builder.createTopology(), args);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Java RMI with Apache Heron provides a convenient way to enable communication between distributed components in a Heron topology. By leveraging these technologies, developers can build robust and scalable real-time stream processing applications.
